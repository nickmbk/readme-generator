  # SAMPLE README FILE

  ## Description

  This application generates a readm file.  This readme file has been generated using the readme generator app.  THis is to show a sample of what it can create.

  This app is supposed to make the task of creating a readme file quicker.

  For this project the technologies used were JavaScript and Node Js, along with the Inquirer module for Node JS

  Challenges faced in this project were with Inquirer. I had to read some documentation to get it to work how I needed it to.

  I have learnt how to use Node more and how to use Inquirer

  I would like to make the app more advanced to accept more specific input from the user to customise the readme document more.  For example if a field is left blank then that heading is not added to the README file.
